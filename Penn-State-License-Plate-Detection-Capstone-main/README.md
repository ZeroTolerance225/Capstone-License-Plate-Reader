Problem Statement:

The License Plate Recognition App is designed to address the inefficiencies and environmental concerns associated with traditional parking passes. Each semester, the issuance of physical parking passes leads to considerable waste once they expire. Additionally, the process of obtaining these passes is often cumbersome, involving long waiting lines. This system also poses challenges for individuals who need to switch passes between multiple vehicles. Our project aims to streamline parking management by eliminating physical passes, thereby reducing waste and simplifying the process for users. This shift towards a digital solution not only enhances convenience but also promotes environmental sustainability.
